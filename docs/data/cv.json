Eclipse environment provides some projects for supporting IoT development. The capability of one project and the relations among different projects are not clear enough for building an IoT application as a beginner of IoT development. We present those projects by generating word clouds and identify their relations by natural language processing techniques. (result) Some relations are verified by implementing some experiments;meanwhile. The accuracy of these word clouds and their relations are verified by the Eclipse Foundation.",
